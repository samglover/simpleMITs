<h5>What are MITs?</h5>
<p>MITs are the two or three most important things you could do each day. If you do nothing else that day, at least you’ll have accomplished two or three important things! </p>
<p>Setting MITs is a daily practice. Every morning, review your lists, calendars, inboxes, and project boards, and write down two or three tasks to be your focus for the day. It’s okay to have four or five MITs, but if you have six or seven (or more), consider whether they really are the most important things you could be doing that day. Keeping your MITs manageable helps you be more productive.</p>
<p><em>No matter what else you do today, get your MITs done.</em></p>
<p><small>I wrote <a href="https://lawyerist.com/blog/most-important-tasks/" target="_blank">more about MITs</a> on <em>Lawyerist</em>. I first learned about MITs from <a href="https://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/" target="_blank">this post on <em>Zen Habits</em></a>, which was inspired by <a href="https://lifehacker.com/geek-to-live-control-your-workday-187074" target="_blank">this post on <em>Lifehacker</em></a>.</small></p>

<h5>What is simpleMITs?</h5>
<p>I wanted a simple way to keep track of my MITs on my phone or computer, but separate from my regular task lists, project management software, email inboxes, and calendars.</p>

<p>By design, simpleMITs is, well, simple. What you see is what you get. You don't even need to log in; all your tasks are stored in your browser's local storage. However, here are a few features that might not be obvious:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To reorder tasks, drag and drop them using the three-dot "handles" next to the task. (Desktop only.)</li>
  <li>To edit a task, click on the task. Click enter/return to save the edited task, or just click outside the task.</li>
  <li>To complete a task, click the number next to the task. You can un-complete tasks, as well.</li>
  <li>To delete a task, click the <strong>&times;</strong> next to the task.</li>
  <li>If you add more than five tasks, the additional tasks will be dimmed along with any completed tasks to help you focus on the top five.</li>
  <li>simpleMITs works great if you add it to the home screen of your phone or tablet.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Where are my tasks stored?</h5>
<p>Your tasks are <em>only</em> stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing you enter is stored on this server. Your tasks will still be here when you return as long as you use the same browser on the same device.</p>
<p>Clearing your browser cache will also clear your tasks.</p>
