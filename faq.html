<h5>What are MITs?</h5>

<p>MITs is short for Most Important Tasks. MITs are the two or three most important things you could do today. And if you do nothing but your MITs today, you will still be able to feel good about what you accomplished.</p>

<p>Make your MITs a daily practice. Every morning, go over your task lists and calendars and write down two or three MITs. At least one of them should be related to your goals for your life or business.</p>

<p>It's okay to have four or five MITs some days. But if you have six or seven (or more), consider whether they really are the <em>most important</em> things you could be doing today. Keeping your MITs manageable helps you be more productive.</p>

<p><em>No matter what else you do today, get your MITs done.</em></p>

<p><small>I wrote <a href="https://lawyerist.com/blog/most-important-tasks/" target="_blank">more about MITs</a> on <em>Lawyerist</em>. I first learned about MITs from <a href="https://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/" target="_blank">this post on <em>Zen Habits</em></a>, which was inspired by <a href="https://lifehacker.com/geek-to-live-control-your-workday-187074" target="_blank">this post on <em>Lifehacker</em></a>.</small></p>

<h5>What is simpleMITs?</h5>

<p>I wanted a simple way to keep track of my MITs on my phone or computer, but separate from my regular task lists, project management software, email inbox, and calendars.</p>

<p>By design, simpleMITs is, well, simple. What you see is what you get. You don't even need to log in; all your tasks are stored in your browser. However, here are a few features that might not be obvious:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the form to add tasks.</li>
  <li>To complete a task, click the number next to the task. You can un-complete tasks, as well.</li>
  <li>To delete a task, click the <strong class="text-muted">&times;</strong> next to the task.</li>
  <li>If you add more than five tasks, the additional tasks will be dimmed to help you focus on the top five. So will completed tasks.</li>
  <li>simpleMITs works great if you add it to the home screen of your phone or tablet.</li>
  <li>[Coming Soon] To edit a task, click on the task. Click enter/return to save the edited task.</li>
  <li>[Coming Soon] To reorder tasks, just drag and drop them.</li>
</ol>

<p><small>For updates, see the <a href="https://github.com/samglover/simpleMITs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</small></p>

<h5>Where are my tasks stored?</h5>

<p>Your tasks are <em>only</em> stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing you enter is stored on this server. Your tasks will still be here when you return as long as you use the same browser on the same device.</p>

<p>Clearing your browser cache will also clear your tasks.</p>

<h5>What if I have a different question?</h5>
