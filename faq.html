      <h5>Most Important Tasks (MITs)</h5>
      <p>MITs are the two or three things that, if you accomplish nothing else today, will make for a productive day.</p>
      <p>Each day, write down two or three MITs. It's okay to have four or five. If you have seven (or more), consider whether they really are the <em>most important</em> things you could be doing today.</p>
      <p>No matter what else you do, get your MITs done. Keeping your task list manageable helps you be more productive.</p>
      <p>I wrote <a href="https://lawyerist.com/blog/most-important-tasks/" target="_blank">more about MITs</a> on <em>Lawyerist</em>.
      <h5>About simpleMITs</h5>
      <p>I wanted a simple way to keep track of my MITs on my phone or computer, so I built this web app. All it does is hold your MITs for the day. You can move them around (coming soon), edit them (coming soon), check them off, and delete them. That's it! (What more do you really need?)</p>
      <p>simpleMITs is intentionally ephemeral, just like the index cards I used to use for a day, then toss in the recycling.</p>
      <p>By the way, it works just as well as an app on your phone or tablet if you add it to your home screen.</p>
      <h5>Privacy</h5>
      <p>Your tasks are <em>only</em> stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing you enter is stored on this server. Your tasks will still be here when you return, as long as you use the same browser.</p>
      <p>Clearing your browser cache will also clear your tasks.</p>
